            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
                Working with software isn't simply a job; it is my career. Programming is not just a tool; it is my passion.
                Before you lies a motivated independent self-learner with an infallible positive mindset. Leading a team is just as important as helping your team grow.
                I have a strong desire to collaborate with a team to create efficient and user-friendly software that will positively affect the life of each client.

                        ASP.NET, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript project. I wrote the requirements document, the user flow diagram,

                        purchased the server space, configured the ASP.NET settings on server, deployed the application.

                    out another engineer so they get their work in on time.
                    He's an absolute joy to collaborate with, receives feedback well, and will elevate the camaraderie on your team.
                    When I worked at ARCOS, I had the pleasure of working with Sean.
                    We worked on a team that implemented SCRUM together and Sean really helped me champion that process.
                    Sean is an excellent developer and always had a very low percentage of bugs on his cases.
                    Sean also takes the time to mentor other engineers. I couldn't recommend him enough!

                    Sean is amazing to collaborate with. Not only is his code reliable, but he also unit tests his
                    work and also provides detailed testing notes. I have watched Sean shine as he mentors new
                    developers and I have bee fortunate enough to read his onboarding plans which are comprehensive
                    and detailed. He really cares about the success of his team. Sean is friendly to work with and
                    a good teacher. When I have questions, I can rely on him (even if it is not something he is
                    currently working on). But even better than just helping me, when he sees gaps he has provided
                    a ton of documentation and diagrams for our repository. He volunteers for the toughest assignments
                    and does not even wince when under pressure - even when priorities change or deadlines loom.
                    He has an agile mindset and collaborates well with everyone. He is an asset to every team,
                    providing mentorship and an upbeat attitude even when volunteering to take on hard challenges.
                    Anyone who works with him is fortunate!
